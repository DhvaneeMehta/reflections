Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. Whenever I want to 
a) work on the project on multiple devices
b) backup my project on cloud
c) collaborate my project with others

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. I might want to seperate changes between my local and remote, because it makes me easier to finish my ongoing job and not getting lost where I am now.
